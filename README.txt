RK4 solver written in Swift used to generate baseball paths based on air resistance.

Fun fact: Willie Stargell was the first player ever to hit a baseball out of Dodger Stadium,
  with his 506-foot, 6 1/2-inch blast off Alan Foster in 1969 still the longest home run
  ever hit at the stadium. This case gets close to the data point (506.5, 0).
